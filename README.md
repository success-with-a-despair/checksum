# checksum
Calculating an 8, 16, or 32 bit checksum for a given input file.

This project calculates the checksum for text provided in a file.

The program takes two command line parameters: (1) the name of the input file, (2) the size of the checksum which much be either 8, 16, or 32 bits. Based upon the input, the program generates output to the console (terminal) screen.
